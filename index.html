<p><strong>Personally Hand made Jewely with Unique no two alike</strong>
<hr>

<p>I worked with photography capturing images around Texas and other areas we traveled. I started doing scrollsaw woodwork as I wanted to make a special birthday gift our daughter's 11th birthday. An Adipose with her name was my very first creation, which flourished into a hobby as it was a great escape.After having baby #4, it became harder to spend hours in the garage enjoying making my wood creations. I started looking into hobbys that I could do and still be close to our baby. I had seen a tree of life Christmas ornament years prior. They are beautiful, so I decided I wanted to give them a shot. I started watching videos, but quickly adapted my own unique style. I quickly grew a love for creating beautiful creations with wire and gemstones. I use natural gemstones, no two trees or pendants are alike and no stone is identical to the next.
